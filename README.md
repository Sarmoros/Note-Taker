# Note Taker

A note-taking application that allows user to take notes, saving them, and retrieving them at any moment. The user can provide a title and description for their notes, then click save, and it will send the notes to a list on the left side of the note-taking application. From the list of notes with the titles, you can click any of the previous notes taken, prompting any of your choice to open, as the back-end will store them. With that, managing your notes will be very simple and easy, even allowing you to delete any of the previous notes.
